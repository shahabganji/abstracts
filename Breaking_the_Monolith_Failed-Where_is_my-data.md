## Breaking the Monolith Failed! Where is my data?


There's a myriad of complexity in breaking a monolith and modernize your products. There are countless books and
articles helping how we could gradually replace the old functionalities and code bases with new one. Patterns like
Strangler Fig, enables the software team to have control over how the old system will be finally shut down and the new
system seamlessly fulfill old and new requirements. However, the core part of every software system is the data behind
it. A software without data is like a joke without a punchlineâ€”leaves you hanging.

Being able to liberate the data in legacy applications and integrate them into the new systems is just as important as
changing the code base and how the components of system are organized; having a modern and flexible data model serving
the new requirements of the system requires to know how we could untangle our new design from the old model.

We will examine different patterns that can be leveraged to liberate data in your system and make them
flow in the veins of it. We will examine the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, talk about tools we could
employ to achieve this goal. By the end of this session, we will be better equipped to make informed decisions about how
to migrate and synchronize data in our software applications.
