# Decoding Compilers: Empowering Developers with Roslyn

Onboarding new developers and imposing programming patterns and guidelines can take a good amount of time from your
team. Roslyn with its rich APIs is helping us to tackle these challenges at compile time. In this session we will
investigate Compiler APIs from Roslyn and how they assist to create Semantic Analyzers and Code Fixers tailored for your
team. With Semantic Analysis you can ensure the given program is semantically consistent with language definition, and
with Semantic Analyzers you can extend it to best practices and coding patterns. Code Fixers provide suggestions for the
already written code to be replaced with an alternative, this way your teams' developers will have an extra tool in
their toolbox for writing better code addressing their needs. In the session, we will showcase how to save time on
development and during code reviews through unifying the build on your machine and CI/CD pipelines.
