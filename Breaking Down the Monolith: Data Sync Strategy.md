Data is an important asset of any company, and living in a world where companies require creating new services and moving away from their legacy applications to be responsive enough to the requirement changes in the market, it is vital to know how to keep data in sync between various parts of the system. Data streams are unavoidable, and knowing how to deal with them is crucial. Companies face challenges like: How do you ensure consistency between the old and the new system? How do you avoid the "old" domain model polluting the new one? How do you avoid a Big Bang migration?


 In this workshop, we will first analyze different approaches to performing a migration. Then, we will implement a strategy to react to data changes and notify other applications.


At the end of the workshop, attendees will have enough confidence to describe and plan a data migration and synchronization strategy for your company's needs.


Intended Audience:

This session is aimed at developers and architects who want to gain their first hands-on experience with event-driven architectures. Proficiency in either of Java or .NET and basic understanding of Docker is required.
