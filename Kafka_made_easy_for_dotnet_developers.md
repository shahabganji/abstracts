## Kafka made easy for .NET Developers

Everyone talks about Event Driven Architecture and Kafka! Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform
used by thousands of companies for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and
mission-critical applications. It also comes with a rich echo system of tools like Kafka Stream and Kafka Connect.

We will look into building blocks of it, from records, partitions and (de)serilization to schema registry and kafka
streams; we will have some codes to examine .NET libraries that can help us to leverage the power of Kafka. This session
will equip you with confidence to use Kafka in your next messaging solution.
