## Building an Event Sourcing System With Azure Cosmos DB

Event sourcing and Event-Driven Architectures are great ways to scale your system bringing scalability, elasticity,
and resilience within today's software systems. Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi model and scalable
database.

In this session, we will learn and examine the intrinsic details of Event Sourcing and how we could leverage Azure
Cosmos DB to achieve it. We will examine how to store events, getting states back, creating read models to satisfy
queries, and how to propagate necessary data in near real time, as events are happening, to other parts of the system.
