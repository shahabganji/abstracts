A developer's life is filled with excessive tasks and distractions, they could get side-tracked from the
actual code that should be written, just because of the ceremonies of a tool or framework. It is also crucial for them
to have feedback as quick as possible when they are implementing a business requirement. In fact, the essence of a good
developer experience is that she is focused on the code that should actually be written. This boosts productivity and
confidence of our team members and enables them to enjoy coding rather than suffering.

Compilers are the core component of every programming language and a tool that developers spend so much time with; In
this talk we will take a deep look into how we could equip our development team by leveraging the power of Roslyn
compiler and using its capabilities (such as Diagnostic Analyzers, Code Fix Providers and Source Generators) to offer a
smooth DevEx and empower our development team on their day to day challenges.

# Revised of Mine

Developers often find themselves bogged down by unnecessary ceremonies—configuring tools, enforcing code standards, and
dealing with repetitive boilerplate—when they should be focusing on delivering business value. A seamless developer
experience (DevEx) reduces these distractions, shortens feedback loops, and keeps developers engaged in writing
meaningful code.

In this talk, we’ll explore how Roslyn, the .NET Compiler Platform, can be leveraged to create a
smoother developer experience. By using Diagnostic Analyzers, Code Fix Providers, and Source Generators, we can automate
tedious tasks, enforce best practices effortlessly, and offer instant feedback to developers within their IDE.

Through real-world examples, we’ll see how teams can eliminate common pitfalls, improve code consistency, and boost
productivity—all without disrupting their workflow. Whether you’re a junior developer, an experienced engineer, or a
team lead, this session will provide actionable insights to help you empower your team and enhance their daily
development experience.

## Developer Experience First: Using Roslyn to Eliminate Friction and Boost Productivity
## Supercharging Developer Experience with Roslyn: Fewer distractions, More focus

Every minute spent struggling with tools, deciphering obscure errors, or writing boilerplate code is a minute not spent
solving real problems. The essence of a great Developer Experience (DevEx) is about reducing friction and helping
engineers stay focused on what matters—building value.

But what if our compiler could become an ally in this effort? In this session, we’ll explore how Roslyn, the .NET
Compiler Platform, can be leveraged to automate, analyze, and enhance our daily development workflows. From diagnostics
that prevent common pitfalls to Code Fix Providers that enforce best practices effortlessly, and Source Generators that
eliminate repetitive coding, we’ll see how these features create a more fluid, distraction-free development experience.

We’ll explore how small changes can have an impact on a team’s workflow. Instead of spending time on distractions,
developers can focus on building great software. If you care about DevEx and want practical ways to improve how your
team writes code, here is where we talk about it.

## From Interruptions to Impact: Boosting Developer Experience with Roslyn


Writing great software is hard enough; and why should developers waste time fighting with unnecessary ceremonies,
verbose boilerplate, or slow feedback loops? A smooth developer experience (DevEx) allows engineers to focus on
delivering business value rather than wrestling with tooling configurations, repetitive tasks or hunting hidden bugs.

In this session, we’ll explore how Roslyn, the .NET Compiler Platform, can streamline development and bring immediate
and better Developer Experience to your team. Expect practical takeaways you can apply right away. We’ll look at how
Roslyn can help you write cleaner, more consistent code without extra effort—so you spend less time hunting hidden bugs
and more time solving real problems. Whether you’re just starting out or leading a team, you’ll leave with ideas on how
to make development smoother for yourself and your colleagues.

## Deep Work in .NET: Leveraging Roslyn for a Seamless Developer Experience

In the fast-paced world of software development, every second counts. Developers should be focused on solving business
problems—not struggling with tool configurations, enforcing code conventions manually, or drowning in finding bugs
because of tooling. A great Developer Experience (DevEx) means minimizing friction, shortening feedback loops, and
letting developers do what they do best: write great code.

We’ll go beyond theory and look at practical ways to use Roslyn to cut down on distractions. The goal? To let
developers focus on what actually matters. Whether you’re new to Roslyn or looking to take your tooling to the next
level, you’ll walk away with practical ideas to make your development workflow smoother and more
efficient.
