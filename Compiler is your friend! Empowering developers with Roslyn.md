# Compiler is your friend! Empowering developers with Roslyn

Compilers are the core component of every programming language we use to develop applications, and letting them do the
repetitive work, especially if it’s something that multiple developers need to do. You’ll save time and reduce
errors, making your workflow smoother and more efficient. Plus, onboarding new developers and imposing programming
patterns and guidelines can take a good amount of time from your team.

Roslyn with its rich APIs is helping us to tackle these challenges at compile time. In this session we will
investigate Compiler APIs from Roslyn and how they assist to create Source Generators, Semantic Analyzers and Code
Fixers tailored for our team.

~~With the help of source generators we can automate a lot of repetitive tasks, reducing errors and enhancing developer's
productivity. Semantic Analysis help us to ensure the given program is semantically consistent with language definition,
and
with Semantic Analyzers you can extend it to best practices and coding patterns. Code Fixers provide suggestions for the
already written code to be replaced with an alternative, this way your teams' developers will have an extra tool in
their toolbox for writing better code addressing their needs.~~

~~In the session, we will showcase how to leverage Roslyn APIs to enhance productivity and reduce wasted time in your
development environment through unifying the build on your machine and CI/CD pipelines.~~
