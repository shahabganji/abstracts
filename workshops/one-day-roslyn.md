Hands-on: Roslyn Source Generators
Abstract
// <auto-generated/>

In todayâ€™s fast-moving world of software development, in order for engineers to be able to focus on the business rules and domain logic, it is imperative to delegate infrastructural plumbing to the compiler. As C# coders, we have the advantage of utilizing Roslyn to generate such boilerplate code. Additionally, source-level interception can replace reflection-based dynamic code for trim-friendlier applications.

At the end of this workshop, you have hands-on experience of how the .NET ecosystem employs Source Generators for high-performance solutions, and a solid understanding of how frameworks like ASP.NET Core use Interceptors to enable Native AOT (ahead-of-time compilation) for Minimal APIs.
