Hands-on: Roslyn

We as developers use Compilers and IDEs the most during our day-to-day job. They help us navigate, write and refactor code efficiently and focus on providing value for the business. However, the general toolchain lacks domain-specific knowledge. Roslyn, the .NET Compiler Platform, allows extending its capabilities by providing additional context, bringing even more productivity to the team!

Diagnostic Analyzers and Code Fix Providers are two components that shorten the feedback loop for developers to catch and fix potential issues already at design-time. Source Generators delegate infrastructural plumbing to the compiler by auto-generating boilerplate code, saving developersâ€™ precious time. Additionally, source-level interception can replace reflection-based dynamic code to enable Native AOT (ahead-of-time compilation) support.

You will leave this workshop with hands-on experience and a solid understanding of the Roslyn APIs which helps you to bring context-aware developer experiences to your teams, whether you are building applications or libraries.
