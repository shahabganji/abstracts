The most prominent shift we've observed in the field of distributed systems over the last decade is probably the
transition from traditional synchronous integrated systems to message-driven means. This change is a logical response to
the high demands for scalability, elasticity, and resilience within today's software systems. Regardless of how
overwhelming the array of message-based options may seem, Cosmos DB serves as an incredible solid backbone for most of
them, whether utilised as a transactional outbox or a fully-fledged event store in the context of event-sourcing. By
diving deeper into real-world experiences, we will discover the mechanics of how Cosmos DB can guarantee nearly infinite
scalability if you follow a few basic principles and patterns to efficiently model your data. While Cosmos DB should not
be considered as another silver bullet, this talk will teach you why you should certainly keep it as a prominent tool in
your toolkit when it comes to building event-driven systems at scale.
